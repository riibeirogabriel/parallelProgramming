# parallelProgramming
In this project, is used parallel programming to to solve several problems (Building)

## matrixesMultiply

### multiplicator
A simplist implementation of matrixes multiplication.

### n_threads_multiplicator
In this approach, the code use threads to multiply each line from matrixes multplication, joining the work in result matrix.

### n3_Threads_multiplicator
In this approach, the code use threads to multiply each line from matrixes multplication,
and in each line thread, have n threads to muplipy each celula multiplication joining the work in result matrix.

### plus_n3_threads_multiplicator
Is same approach of multiplicatorN2Threads, but the celula's plus in each line multiplication is perfomed by threads.
