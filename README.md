# parallelProgramming
In this project, is used parallel programming to solve math and compute problems.

## matrixesMultiply

### multiplicator.py
A simplist implementation of matrixes multiplication

### n_threads_multiplicator.py
In this approach, the code use threads to multiply each line from matrixes multiplication, joining the work in a result matrix

### n3_Threads_multiplicator.py
In this approach, the code use threads to multiply each line from matrixes multiplication,
and in each thread line, has n threads to muplipy each celula multiplication joining the work in a result matrix

### plus_n3_threads_multiplicator.py
Is same approach of n3_Threads_multiplicator, but the celula's plus in each line multiplication is perfomed by threads.
