# multiplicator
A simplist implementation of matrixes multiplication

# n_threads_multiplicator
In this approach, the code use threads to multiply each line from matrixes multiplication, joining the work in a result matrix

# n3_Threads_multiplicator
In this approach, the code use threads to multiply each line from matrixes multiplication,
and in each thread line, has n threads to muplipy each celula multiplication joining the work in a result matrix

# plus_n3_threads_multiplicator
Is same approach of n3_Threads_multiplicator, but the celula's plus in each line multiplication is perfomed by threads.
